# Hotel-Predictions
Need to predict the customer will do checkIn or not in the hotel-Machine learning
More Bonus points (You can write answers to these in ReadMe)

1.Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution).
 When i working in last company ,we are facing issue for transferring file from one machine to other,that time i created one virtual server through which we can transfering any kind of file without size limitation.
i think right time quick decision is most important.

2.Explain back propagation and tell us how you handle a dataset if 4 out of 30 parameters have null values more than 40 percentage
 Answer-Handle Missing Values in Machine Learning 
The handling of missing data is very important during the preprocessing of the dataset as many machine learning algorithms do not support missing values.
There is no thump rule to handle missing values in a particular manner, the method which gets a robust model with the best performance.
For the above problem we will go through these two techniques.

1.Deleting Rows with missing values---Loss of a lot of information.
Advantage-A model trained with the removal of all missing values creates a robust model.

2.Impute missing values for continuous variable with Mean/Median--Can cause data leakage.
Advantage-Prevent data loss which results in deletion of rows or columns
Works well with a small dataset and is easy to implement.
